11_voice_NPC_5004_100#0,"""Oh, uh... Take care, okay?"""
11_voice_NPC_5004_101#0,"""There are so many people here. So many things to see, I'm almost dizzy. I wonder why, it's so much fun."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#1,"""I don't remember much of the past, but for some reason it doesn't worry me. ...I wonder why?"""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#2,"""I know I've seen everyone gathered around like this before, but it all feels fresh to me. ...I'm enjoying just watching."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_105#0,"""Sometimes I have dreams. I don't remember what happens in them, but they're strange dreams. They're kind of frightening, familiar..."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_101#1,"""Welcome back, <%me>.<br>Working hard as usual, I see. Yep, working hard."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_105#1,"""I was very lucky to be rescued, but I can't help but wonder if there are more out there like me."""
Matoi_08_020#0,"""If there are... I kind of feel bad that I was the only one saved."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_105#2,"""Being an ARKS member looks tough, but everyone looks so lively, I'm really jealous. I hope I can stand by their side one day."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#0,"""Me? I'm not bored at all. I have you and lots of other people to talk to."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#3,"""I wonder what I'll do once I get better. Oh... just as a goal, I mean. Just thinking about it helps me keep going."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#1,"""ARKS members always seem to be so well dressed. I wish I had something nicer to wear..."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#4,"""Hmm... I wonder why I don't have many memories left, but I feel so liberated right now."""
Matoi_13_020#0,"""I wonder whether there wasn't much I could do in my past life, and I was suffocating because of it? If that's the case, maybe this is happiness."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#2,"""Do you know where they get all of the data they put up on that big monitor? It's good to have, but it's very strange."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_105#3,"""I heard the ARKS ship has been in space for over 200 years. Why do you think it set off in the first place?"""
Matoi_15_020#0,"""Were they just searching for adventure? I can't seem to find any history on what happened before that."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_105#4,"""Photons are in the air all around us, right?"""
Matoi_16_020#0,"""It's weird that some people are in tune with them and others aren't, even though they're everywhere."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#5,"""I've been really enjoying reading books and data. I can't make any rigorous movements, so I'm reading anything I can get my hands on."""
Matoi_17_020#0,"""When you compare two accounts of the same thing, you sometimes get totally different perspectives. It's fascinating."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#6,"""Oh, welcome back. Or is it good morning?"""
Matoi_18_020#0,"""Ha ha. You ARKS members work such irregular hours, I have no idea what to say sometimes. Let's make it \""Good Morning!\"""""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#3,"""Is everything alright? Are you overworking yourself? You can't hide it from me, you know. You have a scary expression on your face. Please, please look after yourself, okay?"""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#4,"""Oh... <%me>.<br>Um, take care of yourself, okay? For some reason, I have a feeling something bad is going to happen."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_105#5,"""Everything feels so sad... I can sense it in the photons around here. What happened?"""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#7,"""The air around here feels so light. Maybe it's everyone's positive energy? Ha ha. I like it."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#5,"""<%me>...<br>Is everything alright? I worry that terrible things might be happening."""
Matoi_mb9_020#0,"""If I'm imagining it all, that's fine. But don't try to handle it all yourself, okay?"""
Matoi_mb9_030#0,"""When you're having a tough time, you should just say so. If you don't, no one will realize and you'll be all alone..."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#6,"""Ah... <%me>.<br>Did you find the dragon you were looking for?"""
Matoi_mb10_020#0,"""I heard that it was on a rampage. But why did it rampage in the first place? ...I wonder what happened."""
Matoi_mb10_030#0,"""...I've got a really bad feeling about this. Please take care of yourself, I mean, really."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#8,"""It seems like that tournament I mentioned before is going to be broadcast live."""
Matoi_mb11_020#0,"""So, how do I put this...? I want to watch you in battle, <%me>."""
Matoi_mb11_030#0,"""I'm mostly just genuinely interested, but I also feel like if I were to watch, I might be able to remember something."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#7,"""<%me>.<br>Your face is all stiff. Are you okay? Did something happen?"""
Matoi_mb12_020#0,"""If it's nothing, that's fine... but you shouldn't take on so much on your own."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_106#0,"""<%me>... I'm okay. I'm actually so calm that I'm quite surprised myself."""
Matoi_mb13_020#0,"""I believe in Xion. Especially since Xion was smiling at you."""
Matoi_mb13_030#0,"""...Oh, you didn't see that? No, it was nothing like that. Xion was definitely smiling."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#9,"""<%me>. It's so exciting!"""
Matoi_mb14_020#0,"""So let's keep the stuff about Xion between you and me. Our little secret. Okay?"""
Matoi_mb14_030#0,"""...hehe, this is kinda nostalgic, interacting like this."""
Matoi_mb15_010#0,"""<%me>ã€‚<br>I'm feeling a little bit nervous right now."""
Matoi_mb15_020#0,"""Not of you, but our surroundings. What is it, what's going on? I feel like something is changing."""
Matoi_mb16_010#0,"""<%me>, are you alright?<br>You're not wound up in something weird, are you?"""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#8,"""I feel like you've got this cold air about you. I'm hoping it's not anything in particular......"""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#9,"""Oh, <%me>.<br>Yeah, I'm physically okay."""
Matoi_mb16zeno_020#0,"""Philia took away my weapons saying I shouldn't overdo it... But really, I'm physically fine."""
Matoi_mb16zeno_030#0,"""...I guess this is all thanks to Xion.<br>...Xion."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#10,"""Heheh, I'm glad. Because from now on, I can go on missions with you."""
Matoi_mb18_020#0,"""<%me>, it would make me really happy if I could help you out."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#10,"""Let's work hard to protect everyone together."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_104#11,"""I don't know why I have to keep going through these checkups. I feel perfectly fine right now..."""
Matoi_mb19_020#0,"""...I know. It's important to go through with them. Philia will tell me off if I don't."""
11_voice_NPC_5004_100#11,"""It's because everyone's worried about me.<br>...OK. If they tell me to do it, I'll do it."""

11_voice_NPC_5568_202#0,"""Ah, Leader. How are you doing?<br>...What's wrong? You have an odd look on your face. Is there something strange about my appearance?"""
11_voice_NPC_5499_204#0,"""Hehe, it feels weird to have Khorshid here on the ARKS Ship, doesn't it?"""
text01003#0,"""It's just as weird for me. It's not so long ago that I wouldn't have dreamed of spending any time in a place like this..."""
text01004#0,"""If I hadn't met you and Gene, I would never have even heard of ARKS, or known all the things you do."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#0,"""I had something to ask you, but...<br>It can wait. Speak to me whenever you're ready to hear it."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_101#0,"""You ARKS have a lot of customs with no parallels in Erzimarut culture. Very interesting."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_202#1,"""Akhtar came here before? Hmm...<br>I can't see any sign of her anywhere."""
text03001#0,"""You ARKS have all sorts of clothes. Look at that woman there. Her outfit is both fashionable and cute."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_104#0,"""That could look good on Akhtar.<br>She's worn the same clothes ever since she became a Darknix."""
text03003#0,"""I think it would look good on you too, Khorshid. Oh... maybe it would be a little tight around the chest..."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_106#0,"""You're one to talk, Gene. Honestly. Perhaps I'd be able to wear clothes like yours, then."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_104#1,"""I wanted to go on a mission, if possible... But when I transform, I spread Darker Factor around me."""
text04002#0,"""If I transformed, I might be mistaken for a hostile.<br>...I want to avoid looking suspicious."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_204#0,"""...Still, being cooped up and unable to fight is grating. I hate having to ask for your help.."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#1,"""I think there are more ARKS starting conversations with me than there were before."""
text05002#0,"""It used to be that they didn't dare approach me. Perhaps dealing with my stress has made me less tense."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_201#0,"""All thanks to you and Gene. It's important that cultural exchanges like this are fun. Heheh, thank you, Leader."""
